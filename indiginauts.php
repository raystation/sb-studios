The Indiginauts are wise-crackin' repairmen.			</p>			<p>				We developed the game as a simplified point-and-click geared toward mobile devices(point and touch on touch devices?). The main goal was to take everything we learned from classic point-and-clicks, like Monkey Island, and streamline and simplify. Top it off with an engaging story, developed characters and fun artwork.			</p>			<p>				Currently we are still working on our first build. We are doing internal testing of the game and I am still producing artwork for the game.			</p>		</div>		<div class="four columns omega add-bottom caption">			<h5>Indiginauts</h5>			<p>Projected Release: 2014<br/>				Platform: Web, Tablets</p>			<p>				<a href="http://www.indiginauts.com/" target="_blank">Demo link</a>			</p>		</div>	</div><?php include 'inc/projects.php' ;?>	<?php include 'inc/footer.php' ;?>
