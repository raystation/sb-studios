"The 3" centered around the basic concept of squaring off against your friends with multiple choice answers. In our first iteration, you had to type out the answers, and that wasn't working out how we hoped, and took too long.</p>			<p>				In our second iteration, we implemented multiple choice with 5 right and wrong answers and set the game time around 2 minutes. We liked this, but ultimately decided that it seemed like people were reading more than they should be, so we decided to cut down the questions and answers to 3, set the timer at one minute and consciously try to keep the wording for questions minimal if possible. We next implemented a system of power-ups and then for the next month went about procuring good trivia questions.			</p>			<p>				We released the game free in the App Store with in-app purchases for new categories as a way to generate revenue. It was also a chance for us to get to know first-hand how the App Store worked and seeing how a game would do with ads and without signifigant marketing dollars put behind it. Currently, it is still in stealth release because we still keeping finding mistakes in the questions (FREAKIN' google spreadsheet!) but we are hoping to squash all (most) mistakes!			</p>					</div>		<div class="four columns omega caption">			<h5>The 3</h5> 			<p>				A Suspended Belief Joint.			</p>		</div>	</div>	<div class="sixteen columns">		<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-3-great-trivia/id694924959?mt=8"><img src="img/appstore-badge.svg">	</div><?php include 'inc/projects.php' ;?><?php include('inc/footer.php') ;?>
